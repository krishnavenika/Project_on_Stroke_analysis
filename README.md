### Project Report: Stroke Analysis

#### Introduction
The stroke analysis project aimed to analyze data related to stroke occurrences and develop predictive models to identify individuals at risk of experiencing strokes. The dataset contained information about individuals' demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and stroke occurrence.

#### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The dataset comprised 5110 samples and 12 features, including ID, gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and stroke occurrence.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Utilized Python's data visualization libraries to explore the distribution of stroke occurrences.
  - Identified class imbalance with 4861 samples associated with no stroke and 249 samples associated with stroke.
  - Balanced the class distribution to ensure equal representation in the dataset.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values, especially in the BMI column, through appropriate imputation techniques.
  - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets while ensuring a balanced class distribution.

#### Implementation of Different Models
Implemented the following machine learning models for stroke prediction:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GAUSSIAN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **LightGBM**
- **XGBoost**

#### Model Implementation Details
- **SVM:**
  - Implemented using scikit-learn library with appropriate kernel functions and hyperparameters.
  - Trained using the training dataset.
  - Evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC).
  - Visualized the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to assess performance.

- **Gaussian Naive Bayes:**
  - Utilized the GaussianNB class from scikit-learn.
  - Trained and evaluated using the same metrics as SVM.
  - Visualized the ROC curve.

- **Random Forest:**
  - Implemented using the RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn.
  - Tuned hyperparameters and trained the model.
  - Evaluated performance and visualized the ROC curve.

- **LightGBM:**
  - Leveraged the LightGBM library for gradient boosting.
  - Conducted hyperparameter tuning and trained the model.
  - Evaluated using standard metrics and visualized the ROC curve.

- **XGBoost:**
  - Implemented using the XGBoost library known for speed and performance.
  - Fine-tuned hyperparameters and trained the model.
  - Evaluated performance and visualized the ROC curve.

#### Model Evaluation Metrics
For each model, the following evaluation metrics were calculated and analyzed:
- **Classification Report:** Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualized the model's performance in predicting true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **Accuracy Score:** Indicated the overall accuracy of the model's predictions.
- **Sensitivity and Specificity:** Determined the model's ability to correctly identify positive and negative cases.
- **Area Under the Curve (AUC):** Measured the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases using the ROC curve.

#### Results and Conclusion
- SVM demonstrated competitive performance with high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC score.
- Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost also showed promising results.
- Gaussian Naive Bayes exhibited relatively lower performance compared to other models.

#### Model Evaluation and Comparison
- Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of all models using various metrics.
- Compared the performance of SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost.
- Analyzed strengths and weaknesses of each model in predicting stroke occurrences.

#### Recommendations and Future Work
- Further fine-tuning of hyperparameters and feature engineering could enhance model performance.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of models with new data for relevance and accuracy.
- Exploration of advanced deep learning techniques for potential insights and improvements in predictive performance.

#### Conclusion
The Stroke Analysis project showcased the feasibility of using machine learning models to predict stroke occurrences based on demographic and health-related factors. The models developed provide valuable tools for healthcare professionals to identify individuals at risk of strokes and implement preventive measures accordingly. The comprehensive evaluation and comparison of multiple models facilitated informed decision-making in developing predictive models for stroke analysis.
